# Low-Quality-Inator-WebUI
Just a WebUI for making stuff low quality

# Installation (not really an installation)

## Windows:

This is in easier terms.

Make sure you have python and pip installed obviously as well as optionally git.

If you do have git installed then clone this respiratory with `git clone https://github.com/Random-Person-RR/Low-Quality-Inator-WebUI.git`

Run `winget install ffmpeg` and `pip install yt-dlp flask`

Then run the python script, and you're done.

## MacOS/Linux:

`git clone https://github.com/Random-Person-RR/Low-Quality-Inator-WebUI.git`

### Arch (btw):
`sudo pacman -Syu` and`sudo pacman -S ffmpeg`

### Other distros:
either use `apt update` and `apt install ffmpeg` or do it like your package manager does it, and do not use pip for ffmpeg as it doesn't actually allow for ffmpeg functionality.

`pip install yt-dlp flask`

`python /path/to/script/low_quality_convertor_webui.py`

## Termux

Same as the Linux one.

# I have no name for this.
NOTE: this code was written by AI, but fine-tuned a bit by me.

NOTE 2: If you use colab, but the video is not downloading or is corrupt, IP blocked, it can't do anything about it.

NOTE 3: images will be converted to video at 25 fps with 1 frame (40 milliseconds), No surprise to people who tried that with FFmpeg.
